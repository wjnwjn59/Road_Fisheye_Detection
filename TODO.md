Task 1
- Show fish-eye image with boundbox 
- De-fisheye an image, after that use yolo (with pretrained) predict the bounding box
- Compare bounding box


Task 2: 
- Interpolate the coords of bounding from fisheye image to rectangle image


Task 3:
- from rectangle image (with bbox) -> interpolate to fish-eye image (with bbox)
